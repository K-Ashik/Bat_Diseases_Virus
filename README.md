## Findings
Virus Distribution among Bat Species:

The dataset provides insights into the distribution of various viruses among different bat species.
Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are prevalent, indicating that bats are significant reservoirs for these viruses.
Detection Methods:

RT-PCR is the most common detection method for identifying bat viruses, followed by PCR and ELISA.
The analysis underscores the importance of employing multiple detection methods for a comprehensive understanding of bat populations.
Bat Species with Highest Virus Counts:

Daubenton's Myotis leads in the number of known viruses, followed by Egyptian fruit bat and Indian flying fox.
Fruit bats, particularly from the Pteropodidae family, appear to be more susceptible to viruses.
Coronavirus Analysis:

Bats are major reservoirs for coronaviruses, with a significant presence of both alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses.
The dataset reveals a high number of bats infected with coronaviruses, emphasizing the potential risk of zoonotic transmission.
Temporal Analysis:

The temporal analysis indicates a peak in sample collection around 2005, with a decline in subsequent years.
Monitoring sample distribution over time provides valuable insights into virus prevalence trends.
Detection Method and Sample Type Relationships:

The analysis explores the relationship between detection methods and sample types, revealing patterns in testing methodologies.
Certain detection methods are more commonly associated with specific sample types.

## Conclusion:

Bats play a crucial role as reservoirs for various viruses, with implications for zoonotic transmission.
The project underscores the importance of ongoing research, monitoring, and effective strategies to mitigate the risk of future pandemics.
